## CS 601 Assignment #6

* This assignment presents an image show/hide page that is programmed using Vue, HTML, and CSS. 
* Created an HTML page with four images to show my growth. 
* Using Vue.js library, I provided the following functionality. When hovering over the image it will change from a current image to a earlier one.
* When the mouse leaves the hovered image, it will switch back to the original pic.
* Another feature I included is a transition component. When the button is clicked the header disappear and reapper.

I'm using a gif image background. The image is of the former first lady *Michelle Obama* letting people know that she is proud to be a black women. Which is why I decided to use that image.
