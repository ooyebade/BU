                I love playing sports. When I was in High School, I was interview by a reporter from <a href="https://www.insidenova.com/sports/stonewalls-elizabeth-oyebade-cant-quit-basketball/article_96206a2e-9ce1-11e5-a759-f798e730dee3.html"

                                This poster was made by my teammates for my last game (senior night) in high school. It was an emotional game for everyone especially
                                the seniors. But although we were emotional, we won the game at the end.

                                This picture was taken when a reporter came to interview during my practice. It was very special to me because it was the first time
                                I've even been interviewed. They asked me about my basketball career and it was very nice to share that.
