When we allow freedom to ring, when we let it ring from every village and 
every hamlet, from every state and every city, we will be able to speed up 
that day when all of God children, black men and white men, Jews and Gentiles, 
Protestants and Catholics, will be able to join hands and sing in the words of 
the old Negro spiritual. Free at last! Free at last! thank God Almighty, 
we are free at last. Injustice anywhere is a threat to justice everywhere. 
We are caught in an inescapable network of mutuality, tied in a single garment 
of destiny. Whatever affects one directly, affects all indirectly.
