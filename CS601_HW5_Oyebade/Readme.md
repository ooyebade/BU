## CS 601 Assignment #5

### **Part 1 - Json**

Created an JSON document to store the following information about my college degree earned to date and those currently working towards:

1. School
2. Program/Major
3. Type (AA, BA, BS, MS, etc.)
4. Year conferred (future dates OK)


### **Part 2 - AJAX and JSON**

1. Uploaded *Part 1 - JSON* file to a web server.
2. Created a *JavaScript* program that performs the following tasks:
    - Wrote the event handler
    - Created a XMLHttpRequest object
    - Wrote the code to create the request for your *JSON* data on the server
    - Sent the request to the server
    - Processed the returned JSON data using *JavaScript*
    - Updated the page content
        - The *JSON* data is displayed in a *HTML* table
3. Uplaoded my *JavaScript* program to the same directory on the webserver where my JSON file resides.
4. Ran the program and verified that it works. 


### **Site Styling**

I'm using the *Radical Gradient* circle farthest-side at center center with a width of 100% for the background. The table that shows the college degree earned is set at 60% width and the border is set at a 3 pixels with a solid black.
